Ugly code that tries to implement the PRST paper en 3D:

    A Planar-Reflective Symmetry Transform for 3D Shapes

Start with the following files:

    * 'main.m': check the type variable: 'vertical' (faster) or 'all'.
               Run it again if you don't get a perfect result.

    * 'main_iterative.m': it is possible to select a point in the hough space a
                         see the corresponding symmetry. See hough0*.jpg images
